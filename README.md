 ## Topic of the project
 Robust Singular Values based on L1-norm PCA

 ## Abstract 
Conventional SVD of a data matrix coincides with standard Principal-Component Analysis (PCA). The L2-norm formulation of PCA promotes peripheral data points and, thus, makes PCA sensitive against outliers. Naturally, SVD inherits this outlier sensitivity. 
In this work, we implemented robust non-parametric method for SVD and singular-value estimation based on a L1-norm formulation, which is named L1-cSVD by authors. We showed that this method demonstrates sturdy resistance against outliers and can facilitate more reliable data analysis and processing in a wide range of engineering applications.
